This directory contains the amber input files.
The order of the simulations with AMBER is as follws
Note: These files will need to be altered slightly to indicate which residues
      are protein to restrain.

Minmize solvant and then all atoms:
1A_solvmin.1.in   
1B_allmin.1.in

Heat slowly to 300K in four steps:
2A_heating1.1.in
2B_heating2.1.in
2C_heating3.1.in
2D_heating4.1.in

Equilibrate: Gradually removing restraints.  The last step is 1.4 ns of unrestrained dynamics
3A_equilibrate.1.in
3B_equilibrate-bb1.1.in
3C_equilibrate-bb2.1.in
3D_equilibrate-bb3.1.in
3E_equilibratef.1.in

Production:  20ns in 8 2.5ns simulations
